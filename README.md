# Homework-03 Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

The motivation for this project was to complete the password generator challenge in Javascript. This homework challenge allows us to practice Javascript by adding code to an existing file. We built this project to generate a random password for the user which may include lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers, and special characters. 


## Installation

Download the homework-03-challenge folder which contains the javascript, html, and css files to open the webpage.

## Usage 

Someone may use this website https://bradford-lee.github.io/homework-03/ if they would like to obtain a random generated password. You may click on the "Generate Password" button which will then present you with a series of prompts for a password criteria. The first prompt requires the length of the password to be a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. If a number is chosen outside of 8-128, an error prompt will pop up and you will not be able to continue with the remaining series of prompts. The remaining prompts ask you to confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters. At least one of these character types must be selected, if not, an error prompt will pop up and you will not be able to generate a password. When all prompts are answered, a random password is generated that matches the selected criteria and your password is displayed on the page. See below screenshot example for reference.
